Permissions 0644 for n8n settings file /Users/chiuyongren/.n8n/config are too wide. This is ignored for now, but in the future n8n will attempt to change the permissions automatically. To automatically enforce correct permissions now set N8N_ENFORCE_SETTINGS_FILE_PERMISSIONS=true (recommended), or turn this check off set N8N_ENFORCE_SETTINGS_FILE_PERMISSIONS=false.

There are deprecations related to your environment variables. Please take the recommended actions to update your configuration:
 - DB_SQLITE_POOL_SIZE -> Running SQLite without a pool of read connections is deprecated. Please set `DB_SQLITE_POOL_SIZE` to a value higher than zero. See: https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/database/#sqlite
 - N8N_RUNNERS_ENABLED -> Running n8n without task runners is deprecated. Task runners will be turned on by default in a future version. Please set `N8N_RUNNERS_ENABLED=true` to enable task runners now and avoid potential issues in the future. Learn more: https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/task-runners/
 - N8N_BLOCK_ENV_ACCESS_IN_NODE -> The default value of N8N_BLOCK_ENV_ACCESS_IN_NODE will be changed from false to true in a future version. If you need to access environment variables from the Code Node or from expressions, please set N8N_BLOCK_ENV_ACCESS_IN_NODE=false. Learn more: https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/security/
 - N8N_GIT_NODE_DISABLE_BARE_REPOS -> Support for bare repositories in the Git Node will be removed in a future version due to security concerns. If you are not using bare repositories in the Git Node, please set N8N_GIT_NODE_DISABLE_BARE_REPOS=true. Learn more: https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/security/
